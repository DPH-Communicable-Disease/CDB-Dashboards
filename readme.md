Hello. This unofficial git contains the underlying code for some of the public facing dashboards created by the NC Division of Public Health, Communicable Disease Branch. The data generated by this code is often then used in Tableau for displaying. 

These dashboards include the NCD3 dashboard found here: https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/figures.html
And the tick-borne disease dashboard found here: https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/diseases/ticks.html
